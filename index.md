## About Me

Welcome!
I am currently an Instructor of Economics at NYU Shanghai, where I focus on labor economics, development economics, health economics, and behavioral economics. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and my research is centered on addressing key public policy issues using advanced microeconomic theories and cutting-edge empirical methods.I am particularly interested in how economic decision-making processes intersect with health and social policy, and how innovative policy design can drive improvements in societal well-being. With strong experience in teaching economics courses at various levels, I bring a passion for both research and education that seeks to contribute meaningfully to academic and policy discussions.
